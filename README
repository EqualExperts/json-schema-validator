IMPORTANT NOTE
=========================================================================================
This is the original Groovy version of our JSON schema validator. It is provided only
for academic interest â€” this version will not be maintained going forward.
Please use the Java version for production use (the Java version is just as easy
to use from Groovy, so this shouldn't be a problem). Also, please note the the Groovy
version doesn't include the JAX-RS integration (the @Schema annotation) that the Java
version has.

We use Gradle (http://www.gradle.org) for our build files

To get started:
 - gradle clean build
 - gradle tasks
 - gradle cleanIdea idea (to generate intellij project files)
